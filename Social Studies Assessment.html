Equality before the law is one of the 30 universal human rights created by the UN. This human right was made with the intention to give all humans equal treatment in court no matter their social standing.  In Mexico alone, there is a major issue with this human right. The US department of state has provided information in 2022 about the number of persecuted people who have gone missing. This number is approximately 3930 people and CNDH(Comisión Nacional de los Derechos Humanos) has received seven complaints of forced disappearances by government agents.

       <br /><br /> <h2 class="hidden animate">How does this affect the well-being of those affected?</h2>
        <p class="hiddenp animate">
            Mexican citizens’ well-being are being affected by the court’s justice system. People who aren’t treated fairly in Mexican court, have either gone missing or reported as an “accidental” death which has severely impacted the people’s trust in the justice system. In 2023, it has been shown that 111,000 people have been forcibly disappeared by government agents . Due to this, Mexicans across the country have lost their majority of human rights.

        <h2 class="hidden animate" >What rights of UDHR are being violated?</h2>
        <ul class="hiddenp animate">
        <li>Article 1 : Free and equal </li>
        <li>Article 2 : Freedom of discrimination</li>
        <li>Article 3 : Right to life</li>
        <li>Article 5 : Freedom from torture</li>
        <li>Article 6 : Right to recognition before the law</li>
        <li>Article 7 : Right to equality before the law</li>
        <li>Article 8 : Access to justice</li>
        <li>Article 9 : Freedom from arbitrary detention</li>
        <li>Article 10 : Right to a fair trial</li>
        <li>Article 11 : Presumption of innocence </li>
        <li>Article 12 : Right to privacy</li>
        <li>Article 30: Rights are inalienable</li>


        </ul>
       <br /><br /> <h2 class="hidden animate">How to raise awareness?</h2>
           <ul class="hiddenp animate">
               <li>Wear a certain colour shirt like pink shirt day - It will spread awareness and make people think of the injustice in Mexico when they look at the coloured shirts.</li>
               <li>Protesting - The average day person can protest against the government until they change the way they handle the law. This shows that anyone can do something about this human rights issue.
               <li>Posts about it and telling others - Social Media is the strongest weapon to spread awareness quickly, especially if everybody tries to help.</li>
    </ul>
   <br /><p class="hiddenp animate">
        In Mexico, there should be fair laws that give every person in court a fair trial. This will empower those without authority to fight back against those who use their power to silence the accused. With these laws in place, many forced disappearances will no longer occur, leading to a safer country.
